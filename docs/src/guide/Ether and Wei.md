# Ether and Wei

Ether (cryptocurrency coin on the Ethereum network for payment) is a payment form in blockchain that facilitates participants to execute their operations on the ethereum network. While Wei is the minor form of ether,

# Example
1 ether = 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 wei (1018).

Another example: let's look at "Wei is to ether" as "satoshi is to bitcoin" - both units are the minor unit from which a user may make a transaction.
