# Introduction

Solidity programming language is a contract-oriented, high-level programming language that supports libraries, complex user-defined types, inheritance, events, assembly language, and implementing smart contracts, and Solidity runs on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

In this tutorial, you will learn about Solidity programming language and how to run it via Remix IDE.

## Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)
the runtime environment for solidity smart contracts in Ethereum is called Ethereum Virtual Machine. It is completely isolated, which means that code running inside the EVM has no access to the network, filesystem, or other processes.  

For the EVM to understand your code, your smart contract will be converted to a bytecode which will be converted to "Opcodes(operation codes). The opcode is what the EVM uses to complete certain tasks.

 The EVM is the master computer to complete all types of tasks on the blockchain. 


## Use Cases 
Solidity can be used to create contracts with the following but not limited to:
* Voting
* Contact form
* Ecommerce
* Crowdfunding
* Election
* Wallets
* Financial app
