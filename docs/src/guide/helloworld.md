# Hello World

A “Hello, world!” program is the traditionally way of introducing a novice software developer to programming. it is the first program you write when learning a new programming language, even if you are an expert in other languages you would still need to start with it.

Note: The second line is a pragma directive which tells that the source code is written for Solidity version 0.8.7

In the example below you will write your first Hello world program using Solidity programming language.

```

pragma solidity ^0.8.7;

contract Helloworld{
   string public hello = "hello world";
}

```
