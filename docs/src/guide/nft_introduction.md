# Introduction

NFT is all over the place on the internet, and I am sure you want to know more about, possibly, how to create and mint your own NFT.
Non-fungible token (NFT) refers to a cryptographic asset on the blockchain that represents an irreplaceable, interchangeable, and unique digital item( music, an image, virtual items, in-game collectible, artworks). 

> Note: it proves authenticity and ownership. 

NFT uniqueness comes from its Metadata which distinguishes it from others.

A Metadata provides information about other data, making it easier to find & work with a particular instance of data. NFTs are distinguished by Metadata, thereby helping users buy or sell objects based on their metadata rather than the entire object. 
If you are interested in selling or sharing NFTs, know that they can be created in the form of digital assets like artworks, music, photography, videos, AR / VR content.

## Choose an NFT Supported Formats
Creators can generate a Non-fungible token from multimedia elements like Text, Audio, Video, and Images. Also, there are products such as virtual items in the VR/ AR world like a weapon, metaverse land, house, car, and video game items.

Creators have the freedom of choice, but keep in mind that after creators choose the content they want as an NFT, they will need to convert it to an NFT supported digital file type.

Add an Image here, to explain how to convert content to nft supported file type.
