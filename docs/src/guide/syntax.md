# Syntax
The rule that describes the structure of a programming language is called syntax. 
Note: If you don't follow the syntax of a programming language, the compiler or interpreter will not understand your code.

Every programming language has its syntax. 

## Example:
 * Naming convention is the primary aim of basic syntax, and it varies by language.

* Case Sensitive.  Identifiers such as world and World have different meanings in the solidity programming language.

* Variable Declaration
